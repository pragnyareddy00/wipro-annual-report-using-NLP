The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows."

If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains
unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting
either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio

The Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating
activities in foreign currency."

earnings and equity to losses."

The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises
independent control over the entire process of market risk management."

recommends risk management objectives and policies, which are approved by our senior management and Audit, Risk
and Compliance Committee."

hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk
limits and policies."

The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies."
3042,"Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the
United States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies."

the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in
foreign currency."

exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows."

statement of profit and loss."
3086,"In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the
deferred tax asset will be realised."
3087,"The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become

3088,"The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment."
3089,"Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that
the Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences."
3090,"The amount of deferred tax asset considered
realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-
forward period are reduced."
3091,"The Company has recognized deferred tax assets of H 112 and H 766 as at March 31, 2025 and 2024 primarily in respect
of capital loss incurred on account of liquidation of an investment."
3092,"Management’s projections of future taxable capital
gain support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilize this deferred
tax asset."
3093,We have calculated our domestic tax liability under normal provisions.
3094,"Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been
recognized towards MAT in the balance sheet for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024."
3095,"The effective MAT rate is
17.47%."
3096,"The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward for a period
of fifteen years and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions."
3097,"A substantial portion of the profits of the Company’s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits
attributable to export operations and profits from units established under Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme."
3098,"Units in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100
percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision of
services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years."
3099,"50% tax deduction is available for a further five
years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions."
3100,"Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible for
preferential tax treatment."
3101,"New SEZ units set up on or after April 1, 2021 are not eligible for aforesaid deduction."
3102,"The tax
holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35."
3103,"The impact of tax
holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of H 11,798 and H 14,308 for the years ended March 31, 2025
and 2024, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate the Company would have been required
to pay if these incentives had not been available."
3104,"The per equity share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024 is H 1.13 and H 1.35, respectively."
3105,"Previous year per equity share effect have been proportionately

differences associated with U.S. branch profit tax where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future."
3108,"Accordingly,
deferred income tax liabilities on branch profit tax at 15% of the U.S. branch profits have not been recognized."

The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows."

is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items."

Financial risk management
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in
the price of a financial instrument."
3928,"The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments."
3929,"Market
risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables,
payables and borrowings."
3930,"The Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating
activities in foreign currency."
3931,"The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company’s
earnings and equity to losses."
3932,"Risk Management Procedures
The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent
control over the entire process of market risk management."
3933,"The corporate treasury department recommends risk
management objectives and policies, which are approved by our senior management and Audit, Risk and Compliance
Committee."
3934,"The activities of this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies
for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies."
3935,"Foreign currency risk
The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies."
3936,"Consequently,
the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and
elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies."
3937,"The exchange rate risk primarily
arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency
loans and borrowings."
3938,A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is in the U.S.
3939,"Dollars, Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian
Dollars and Canadian Dollars, while a large portion of costs are in Indian Rupees."
3940,"The exchange rate between the Indian Rupee
and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future."
3941,"Appreciation of
the Indian Rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company’s results of operations."
3942,"The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative
instruments to mitigate such exposure."
3943,"The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use of
derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency."

to functional currency of the Company would increase/decrease our profit before taxes by approximately H 789 and
H 776, respectively."
3949,"Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowings, including various revolving and other lines of credit."
3950,"The Company’s investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk."
3951,"From time to time, the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into
interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed
upon fixed and floating interest rates."

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed."
3956,"To manage
this, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial
condition, current economic trends, forward-looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts
and ageing of accounts receivable."
3957,"No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of
March 31, 2025 and 2024, and revenues for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024."
3958,"There is no significant concentration
of credit risk."
3959,Trade receivables and unbilled receivables are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
3960,"Indicators
that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a customer to engage in a
repayment plan with the Company."
3961,Refer to Note 11 for changes in the allowances for lifetime expected credit loss.
3962,"Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market
contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits."
3963,"Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities in India which are at
least AA rated by Indian rating agencies."
3964,"Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions
with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings."
3965,"Exposure to these risks
is closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters."
3966,"There are limits on credit exposure to any financial
institution."
3967,"The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements
and capital adequacy ratio reviews."
3968,"Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits of H 21,499 and bank balances of H 63,350 held with three banks
having high credit ratings, which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total cash and cash equivalents

3970,"Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a
reasonable price."
3971,"The Company’s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as
settlement management."
3972,"In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management."

is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items."
4912,"If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged

risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables,
payables and loans and borrowings."

Risk Management Procedures
The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent
control over the entire process of market risk management."
4928,"The corporate treasury department recommends risk
management objectives and policies, which are approved by our senior management and Audit, Risk and Compliance
Committee."
4929,"The activities of this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies
for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies."
4930,"Foreign currency risk
The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies."
4931,"Consequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the
United States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies."
4932,"The exchange
rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables
and foreign currency loans and borrowings."
4933,A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is in the U.S.
4934,"Dollars, Pound
Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars, while a large portion of costs are in Indian Rupees."
4935,"The exchange
rate between the Indian Rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to
fluctuate in the future."
4936,"Appreciation of the Indian Rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations."
4937,"The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency
derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure."
4938,"The Company follows established risk management policies, including
the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in
foreign currency."
4939,"The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange
exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows."
4940,"As at March 31, 2025, a H 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian Rupee with the U.S. Dollar would result in
an approximately H 2,115 (including consolidated statement of income of H 537 and other comprehensive income of
H 1,578) decrease in the fair value, and a H 1 decrease would result in an approximately H 2,134 (including consolidated
statement of income of H 537 and other comprehensive income of H 1,597) increase in the fair value of foreign currency
dollar denominated derivative instruments (forward and option contracts)."

4944,"Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowings, including various revolving and other lines of credit."
4945,"The Company’s investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk."
4946,"From time to time, the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into
interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed
upon fixed and floating interest rates."
4947,"If interest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2025, it
would result in an increase/(decrease) in fair value of interest rate swaps of approximately H 47 and H (48), respectively,
in other comprehensive income."
4948,"If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2025, additional net annual
interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately H 879."
4949,"Certain borrowings are also transacted
at fixed interest rates."
4950,"Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed."
4951,"To manage
this, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial
condition, current economic trends, forward-looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and
ageing of accounts receivable."
4952,"No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as at March
31, 2024 and 2025, or revenues for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025."
4953,"There is no significant concentration
of credit risk."
4954,Trade receivables and unbilled receivables are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
4955,"Indicators
that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a customer to engage in a
repayment plan with the Company."
4956,Refer to Note 9 for changes in the allowance for lifetime expected credit loss.
4957,"Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market
contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits."
4958,"Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities in India which are at
least AA rated by Indian rating agencies."
4959,"Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions

assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or
error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation

assurance engagement."
